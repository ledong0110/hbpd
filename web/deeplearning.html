            <p>
              Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers what to do what comes
              naturally human: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars,
              enabling them to recognize stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the
              key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep
              learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were
              not possible before. Deep learning is Large Neural Networks. In early talks on deep learning,
              Andrew 1 described deep learning in the context of traditional artificial neural network. In the
              2013 talk titled "Deep Learning, Self-Taught Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning", he
              described the idea of deep learning as using brain simulations, hope to:<br>

              <p>
                 <strong>1943:</strong> Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts created a computational model for neural networks
                                         based on mathematics and algorithms called <cite>threshold logic</cite>.

              <p>
                 <strong>1965:</strong> Alexy Grigoryevich Ivakhnenko and Valentin Grigor’evich Lapa made the earliest efforts in
                                         developing Deep Learning algorithms using models with polynomial(complicated equations)
                                         activation functions, that were then analyzed statistically.   
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>1980:</strong> Kunihiko Fukushima proposed the Neoconitron, hierarchical, multilayered artificial neural
                                         network that has been used for handwriting recognition and other pattern recognition problems.
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>1989:</strong> Scientists were able to create algorithms that used deep neural networks, but training
                                      times for the systems were measured in days, making them impractical for real-world use.
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>1992:</strong> Juyang Weng published Cresceptron, a method for performing 3-D object recognition
                       automatically from cluttered scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>Mid-2000s:</strong> The term "deep learning" began to gain popularity after a paper by Geoffrey Hinton
                                            and Ruslan Slakhutdinov showed how a many-layered neural network could be pre-trained
                                            on layer at a time.
              </p>
              <p>
                 <strong>2009:</strong> NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition discovered that with a large
                                         enough data set, the neural network don’t need pre-training, and the error rates frop significantly.

              <p>
                 <strong>2012:</strong> Artificial pattern-recognition algorithms achieve human-level performance on certain tasks.
                                         And Google’s deep learning algorithm discovers cats.

              Deep learning’s major mechanism is based on neural networks. Like animals, our estimator AI’s
              brain has neurons. They are represented by circles. These neurons are inter-connected. The
              neurons are grouped into three different types of layers:

           <li>Input Layer</li>
           <li>Hidden Layer(s)</li>

                 <h5><cite>GPT-3</cite> - The Biggest Achievement Of NLP: The Language Of AI</h5><br>
                 <p>
                    Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning
                    to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n
                    series ( and the sucessor to GPT-2) created by OpenAI, a San Francisco- based artificial intel-
                    ligence research laboratory. GPT-3’s full version has a capacity of 175 billion machine learning
                    parameters. GPT-3 , which was introduced in May 2020, and was in beta testing as of July
                    2020, is part of a trend in natural language processing (NLP) systems of pre-trained language
                    representations. Before the release of GPT-3, the largest language model was Microsoft’s Turing
                    NLG, introduced in February 2020, with a capacity of 17 billion parameters - less than a tenth of GPT-3's.

                    That is one of the hottest topics in deep learning. The idea is in competition between two
                    networks: the generator and discriminator. The first network creates a picture and the second
                    one tries to understand whether the picture is generated or real. During training, the generator
                    from a random vector(noise) generates an image and feeds it to the input of the discriminator,
                    which says whether it is fake or not. The discriminator is also given real images from the dataset.
                    Consequently, the discriminator wins and the training stagnates. However, the advantage of the
                    system is that we can solve problems in which it is difficult for us to set the loss-function (for
                    example, improving the quality of the photo)−we give it to the discriminator.
